# MyPlan App
“MyPlan", (Where am I?) is my first full-stack project! The idea of this web app is to help to better be organized in our life style. As parent, employee and a parent, we have many many challenges and we end up falling behind.

I believe with this user-friendly app, user can create  Plan/course/chapter entries of he/her studying. These entries ( Title, Descriptions/Objectives, Starting-date, End-date, Comment, Rating) will help the user to rate him/herself.

The user can view, delete and update his entries. For eaxample, Anyone who would like spend time studying or working on Project needs to use this app to see if the time spent was valuable. This can be also used in any of our plan.
