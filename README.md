# MyPlan App
â€œMyPlan", (Where am I?) is my first full-stack project! The idea of this web app is to help to better be organized in our life style. As parent, employee and a parent, we have many many challenges and we end up falling behind.

I believe with this user-friendly app, user can create  Plan/course/chapter entries of he/her studying. These entries ( Title, Descriptions/Objectives, Starting-date, End-date, Comment, Rating) will help the user to rate him/herself.

The user can view, delete and update his entries. For eaxample, Anyone who would like spend time studying or working on Project needs to use this app to see if the time spent was valuable. This can be also used in any of our plan.

Some Observations
1-In this  project, I have a better understanding about how to work with API and testing the paths. I started working with the back-end before spending much times with the front-end connecting to the API, particulary sending the right data throught the Ajaxrequest. ..
2- The issue queue help me a lot in this project. I feel more confident in this project, but there are few things I wish I can do to improve.
3- I wish I could add more features to MyPlan like select, view each plan,  the date the plan was made and maybe be set an alert to remind about the due date.
